            <p>Dollar is a 1 and a half year old Australian shepherd. His favorite games are tug of war and fetch. Sometimes, when he goes out for walks, he will pick up a stick to get his owners to play fetch with him. At night, he likes to cuddle with his owners. He would snuggle up and put his nose on their arm to let them know that he wants pets. </p>
            <p>Dollar has a gourmet taste for food. He hates eating kibble and will only eat premium chicken bits with eggs. His favorite snacks are bell peppers, beef bits, and peanut butter. Dollar is incredibly smart and will only do tricks when you present him with snacks.             </p>
